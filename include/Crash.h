/* Hello, and welcome to the source code for Ex Nihilo!
 *
 * This file, `Crash.h`, is a header file that defines the crash system for the project.  It consists of several functions, only two of which matter:  `CrashHandlerSetup ( )`, which set up the crash handler, and `Crash ( )`, which causes a crash.
 *
 * More information on the crash protocol is available in `docs/Problems/CRASHES.md`.  Importantly, this details the difference between the application exit code and the system exit code, and describes what different codes mean. */
