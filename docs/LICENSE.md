## Notes

**THIS PART IS _NOT_ LEGALLY BINDING**

This project uses SDL\_image, SDL\_mixer, and SDL\_ttf.  While I assume that these are all under the zlib license, I can't find a citation for thisâ€”if somebody knows, please file an issue!

Some of the assets are simple enough that they may not qualify for copyright.

Derivative assets will crash the game for safety reasons.

While this license allows you to port to other systems besides Linux, which is the only platform I'm developing this for, since it's the only platform that I have access to, there are certain systems I'd rather you not port this too, including:

- Microsoft Windows
- Mac OS X
- Mac OS
- Most game consoles (although some old consoles have been so thouroughly analyzed and documented that most problems I'd have are moot)
- iOS, iPadOS, iTVOS, or iWatchOS
- Texas Instruments calculators
- Supposedly "smart" appliances (although genuinely smart appliances are fine)

These are almost all closed-source systems that I do not personally support, especially Microsoft, Apple, and Texas Instruments.

With that being said, there are some systems I'm explicitly fine with ports being made for:

- The Internet (despite all of the flaws, it's nicely open and decentralized [mostly])
- FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, etc.
- Android (although I request that you do not distribute it through the Google Play Store; instead, consider an alternative platform, like F-Droid)
