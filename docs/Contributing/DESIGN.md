# Game Design

This document details some basic principles for the design of this game.

## Minimalism

There are a couple of quotes that I'd like to highlight here:

>  Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
>
>  — _Commonly attributed to Albert Einstein_

and

>  [Systems] should be designed not by piling feature on top of feature, but by removing the weaknesses and restrictions that make additional features appear necessary.
>
>  — _Revised⁷ Report on the Algorithmic Language Scheme_

These should be considered before contributing to this project.  This is precisely why I specifically mandate that people state what the problem is that needs to be solved in issues.

Oh, also, this is part of the reason I use C for this.

## Two Manuals

This game contains two manuals:  an interactive user manual, meant to be completed from start to finish, and a comprehensive reference manual, intended to completely and entirely document everything about the game.  As I understand it, this concept originated with the text editor Vim (though the User Manual there isn't interactive).  I really like this concept, and I've integrated it into this game.

## Balances

### Balance of strategy and skill

If a game focuses too much on skill, then certain people will always be better than others, and to get to their level would require more dedication to than would be fun.

If a game focuses too much on strategy, then a perfect strategy will inevitably arrive, everybody will use the strategy, and the game will become very boring.

A good balance of strategy and skill will lead to a fun experience.

### Balance of luck

If a game doesn't focus enough on luck, the player will never need to adapt their gameplay, and the game will always follow the same path.

If a game focuses too much on luck, then it will feel unfair to the player.

A good balance of luck keeps players in suspense, while not being completely game-changing.

### Balance of patterns and diversity

If a game has too many patterns, the player will always know what's coming, and the player will be bored.

If a game has too much diversity, the player will need to memorize too much, and will be overwhelmed.

A good balance of patterns and diversity will lead to a series of matrices with appropriately spaced holes.

### Balance of help

If the player recieves too much help, the player will get angry at the game for not letting the player do enough.

If the player doesn't recieve enough help, the player will get angry at the game for expecting them to know too much.

A good balance of help will leave the player feeling thankful.
