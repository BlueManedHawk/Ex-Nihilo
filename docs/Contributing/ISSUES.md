# How to File an Issue

## Step 0:  Find a problem

This project makes no distinction between feature requests and bug reports, because attempting to define a line in this gradient is impossible to do without making everybody angry.  Instead, this project mandates that each issue report reports something that is _a genuine problem within the game._

Please make sure when reporting a problem that the problem isn't already known about.  Look at `LINGERERS.md`, `REQUIREMENTS.md`, `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, and `QUESTIONS.md`.  You should also understand the game design principles laid out in `DESIGN.md`.  You should also search thoroughly in GitHub in both the open and closed issues to see if the issue has already been reported.

## Step 1:  Describe the problem

This is where you explain what the problem is.

## Step 2:  Explain why this is a problem

This is extremely important.  If this isn't given, the issue will immediately be tagged "Invalid" and closed until/unless a reason is given as to why it's a problem.

## Step 3:  Give some potential solutions

It's completely okay if you can't think of any.  That's why these are public, after all!

## Step 4:  Tag where the issue is

These are the blue tags.  Don't assign a tag that isn't blue.

## Step 5:  Wait for a red tag

This indicates the issue status of the issue.

## Step 6:  Maintain the issue

People may add new information about your issue.  As author of the issue, it is your duty to keep the issue up-to-date with new information.

## Step 7:  Be patient

Eventually, I'll assign the issue a green tag.  This indicates the resolution status of the issue.
