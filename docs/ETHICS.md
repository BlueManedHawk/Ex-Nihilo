# Ethical Concerns

This game contains a number of entities known as "beasts".  If these were to exist in the real world, they would almost certainly be considered living things.  This document goes into more detail about this.

## The Character

The Character is who the player plays as.  This character is always in a cloak, and what's in the cloak is entirely unknown.  The only things that are know is that they make not a noise and they only ever manipulate things bimanu(?)ally.

## The Magical Circuit

The Magical Circuit is every boss in the game—for all practical purposes, the difference between each of the bosses is the Magical Circuit putting on a new costume.  The Magical Circuit is a physical manifestation of chaos and destruction, and seeing as it was formed from dead matter, the Magical Circuit is also dead, in much the same way a vampire is.

## Most everything else

Pretty much every other beast in the game can only be described as an animal—that is, while they're completely _sentient_, they are not in _any_ capacity _sapient_.
