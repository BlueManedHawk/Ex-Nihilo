# Installing

Go to the "Releases" part of the GitHub page and download the latest ELF file and assets.  Run the ELF file, and it will tell you where to put the **decompressed** assets.  Run the ELF file again, and you should be all good.

I intend to eventually provide proper packages for several distributions, but until then, this will have to do.
