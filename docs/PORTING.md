# Porting

## Introduction

I am only planning on developing this game for Linux.  It is what I use and have access to, and I highly suggest you use it, too, even outside of playing this game.

However, the license does allow for the game to theorhetically be ported to any system.  Despite this, I have some recommendations as to where I would prefer you not port it.

## Systems I am fine with ports being made for

### BSD-based systems

These systems are free and open source.  They're fine.

### The Internet

The Internet is a nice, open place.

### Android

Android is a free and open source phone system, and I am fine if you build an APK for this system.  However, I would prefer that you not distribute such an APK through the Google Play Store, as Google is a terrible, terrible company.  Please distribute it through F-Droid or another similarly ethical source.

## Systems I would rather not have ports be made for

### Windows

Windows is a closed-source system that is filled with bloatware and advertising.  It is horrible.  (I also have some personal grudges against Microsoft that I'm not going to go into here.)

### Mac OS X

Mac OS X is a reasonably set-up and organized system that is under a terrible license that forces the user to purchase overly expensive hardware for the "priveledge" of using the system.  That is not a good model.

### iOS

iOS is a horrendously closed system that doesn't give the user anywhere near enough ability to make their phone theirs.  This is a terrible system.

### Consoles

Game consoles are terrible machines.  They're typically region-locked, and usually have extremely stupid DRM systems in them, and additionally are usually rather closed-source.

With that being said, there are some very old consoles that have been completely reverse-engineered, understood, documented, and emulated, typically to such a degree that the problems I mentioned earlier are moot.  For these consoles, I am fine with ports being made.

### Texas Instruments Calculators

Texas Instruments did not gain their monopoly on the calculator market by making good calculators.  They got their monopoly by convincing textbook manufacturers to only include instructions for their calculators.  That is horribly corrupt.

## Remember:

The license does not stop you from porting to these systems.  It is only my request that you do not port to these systems.  However, do keep in mind that there are many, many things that are _legal_, but not _right_, such as:

- War
- Child marriage (in certain jurisdictions)
- Enbyphobia
- Selling printers with a razor-and-blades model
- The fact that the ISO charges for PDFs
