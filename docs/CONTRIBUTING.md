This file explains how you can contribute to Ex Nihilo.

## Issues

_More information:  `ISSUES.md`_

**IMPORTANT:  In the unlikely event that you discover a security issue, _do not report it as a bug!_  This will show it publicly.  Please directly contact me, and I'll take action on it. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for details.**

The main way you can contribute to Ex Nihilo is by opening Issues on Github when you find an issue in the game.  Please be sure to read `DESIGN.md` and `LINGERERS.md` and to search through all issues, _including closed ones_, thoroughly, to make sure that it hasn't been reported before.  You might also want to read `TROUBLESHOOTING.md`, `QUESTIONS.md`, and `REQUIREMENTS.md`.

Attempting to create a definitive line separating the bug report-feature request gradient will only lead to people getting angry, so I'm not going to try.  However, all issues submitted must be _presented as real problems within the game_.  Failure to do so will lead to it being marked as invalid.  Additionally, please make sure to keep issues limited to a single issue per issue.  This helps with keeping track of things.

## Pull requests

Until I can get a more proper understanding of the nuances of copyright, I currently won't be accepting any pull requests.  You still might want to look at `DESIGN.md`, `COMPILING.md`, `ORGANIZATION.md`, and `STYLE.md`.
