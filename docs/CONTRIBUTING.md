# Contributing

This file explains how you can contribute to Ex Nihilo.

## Issues

**IMPORTANT:  In the unlikely event that you discover a security issue, _do not report it as a bug!_  This will show it publicly.  Please directly contact me, and I'll take action on it. See `docs/SECURITY.md` for details.**

The main way you can contribute to Ex Nihilo is by opening Issues on Github when you find an issue in the game.  Assign your issue a blue label based on where the issue is.  **Do not assign a green or red label.  I will assign those when necessary.**

Please be sure to read `TROUBLESHOOTING.md` and to search through all issues, _including closed ones_, thoroughly, to make sure that it hasnt been reported before.

## Wiki

The wiki is currently closed.  It is my hope that the built-in documentation will be enough.

## Pull requests

Due to copyright being weird and confusing and a mess, I will not be accepting pull requests.
