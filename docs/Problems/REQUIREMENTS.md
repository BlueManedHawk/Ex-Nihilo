# Requirements

You will need:

- A Linux operating system.
- To be in a windowing system, I think.
- The libraries for SDL2, SDL\_image, SDL\_mixer, and SDL\_ttf.
- Knowledge of how to set your screen resolution to be correct, even when it's at its lowest (see `LINGERERS.md` for more details).
- A terminal emulator if you want to see the logs.
- At least Novice level in reading.
- A bit of technical know-how.
- A pinch of luck.
- Clang 11, if you want to compile this, since Clang 12 would take up too much space on my Chromebook.
- `make`, if you want to compile this.
- Enough storage space for the game and its assets.
- An unknown amount of RAM.
- A processor of unknown power.  (Bloody hell, English is broken.)
- The is is is the cannot have the yet what do it be.
