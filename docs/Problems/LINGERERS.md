# Lingering Issues

## Massive Problems

If the game experiences a segfault while it's in fullscreen, the entire computer will have its resolution go wonky.

## Smaller annoyances

Messageboxes tend to show the newline graphical character (‚êä, vaugely) in addition to putting a newline.

Sometimes, SDL will insert random log messages of its own.

The "Other Information" section of the crash dialog will sometimes contain seemingly random gibberish.

Text looks like dog vomit, especially outside of Fullscreen and Monadic resolutions, but not enough for me to care.
