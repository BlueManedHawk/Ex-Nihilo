# Concerns About Fairness

I strive to make this game as fair as I possibly can so that anybody may play it without any one person having an advantage over any other.  However, despite this, there will inevitably arise situation in which doing this is impossible.  This document seeks to track each of these instances.

There is no categorization of these by the size of the problem, since all of these are inherently big problems.

- The game makes no attempt to check the screen size of the player's monitor, meaning that people with larger monitors may have an advantage.
