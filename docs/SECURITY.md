# Security

In the unlikely event that you discover a security problem, _**do not report it as an issue!**_  This will make it public, and for security problems, this is very bad.

Instead, please contact me directly regarding security problems.  I will do my best to fix it, release a new version, and issue a security advisory for previous affected versions.  If it's really serious, I may temporarily lockdown the repository.

Don't fret about whether something is serious enough to warrant directly contacting meâ€”**if you think it's a security vulnerability, it probably is.**  _It is completely reasonable to be a bit overzealous with something as important as security_.  If you _really_ want to be sure, you can check the Common Weakness Enumerators database to see if there's an entry: https://cwe.mitre.org/.
