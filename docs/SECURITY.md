# Security

In the unlikely event that you discover a security problem, _**do not report it as an issue!**_  This will make it public, and for security problems, this is very bad.

Instead, please contact me directly regarding security problems.  If it's a serious threat, I will do my best to fix it, release a new version, and issue a security advisory for previous affected versions.  If it's really serious, I may temporarily lockdown the repository.

## What is a security vulnerability?

This is a difficult question to answer, and the line can be very fuzzy.  However, in general, if you think it is a security vulnerability, it probably is, and you should directly contact me.  If it ends up not being a vulnerability, don't worry, and if it is, then don't tell anyone.

The following are some examples of security vulnerabilities:

- Arbitrary code execution
- Access of stuff that shouldn't be accessed

The following are examples of things that fall in that grey area, and which you should probably directly report:

- Duplication glitches
- Corruptions
- Breakage of game flow
