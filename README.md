# Ex Nihilo

## On Hiatus

**This project is currently on hiatus.  Due to circumstances ouside of my control, I don't have any time or energy to be able to work on this, at least for the time being.  Believe me, I _will_ come back to this at some point, and I will overhaul this project; however, I cannot make any guarantees, other than it will not be in my definition of "soon".  I apologize for the inconvenience.**

## Important!

This repository is for the video game Ex Nihilo.  It is still in very early developement, and may cause many problems.  The license is at `docs/LICENSE.md`, and installation instructions are available at `docs/INSTALLING.md`.

## Introduction

The long-term goal of the project is to create a game in which the player starts with nothing and works their way up.  The game will feature extensive magic and technology systems, along with built-in documentation of many parts of the game.  While the game will be a sandbox game, a tree of advancements will exist to help guide the player.
