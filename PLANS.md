# Plans

The long-term goal of the project is to create a game in which the player starts with nothing and works their way up.  The game will feature extensive magic and technology systems, along with built-in documentation of many parts of the game.  While the game will be a sandbox game, a tree of advancements will exist to help guide the player through the basics.

## Short-term goals

### Basic things

- [ ] ~~Draw to the screen~~
- [ ] ~~Draw specific things to the screen~~
- [ ] ~~Have the screen react to keypresses~~
- [ ] ~~Setup drawing text to the screen~~
- [ ] ~~Allow "the screen" to be a window in X11~~

After looking around for a bit, I couldn't find a single damn solution that didn't use X11 and some nonstandard graphics library; therefore, I am unfortunately going to need to use X11 and SDL (which seems like the best choice) in order to do this.  For this reason, I have chosen to reforment this section as follows:

- [X] Create a window
- [X] Draw to the window
- [ ] Draw something specific to the window
- [ ] Allow the window to react to keypresses
- [X] ~~Setup SDL (whatever that means)~~
- [ ] Setup drawing text to the screen

### Basic game things

- [ ] Movable character
- [ ] Placing and destruction of flooring
- [ ] Placing and destruction of not-flooring
- [ ] Interactions with tiles
- [ ] Inventory
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Crafting
- [ ] Beasts
- [ ] Basic placeholder combat
- [ ] Built-in documentation
