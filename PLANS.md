# Plans

The long-term goal of the project is to create a game in which the player starts with nothing and works their way up.  The game will feature extensive magic and technology systems, along with built-in documentation of many parts of the game.  While the game will be a sandbox game, a tree of advancements will exist to help guide the player through the basics.
