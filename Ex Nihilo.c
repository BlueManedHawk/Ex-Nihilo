/* Hello, and welcome to the source code of Ex Nihilo!
 *
 * The environment I use to modify this file is Neovim in the Kitty terminal emulator with the font Fira Code.  I suggest that you do the same for viewing this file.
 *
 * While reading this file, you may notice certain questionable things.  You may want to look at STYLE.md to understand these things and the reason they exist.
 *
 * It is also important to note that this file is normally compiled with clang for C2x.  This file is based off of the latest publically available draft for C2x, which is N2596.  You can get is here:
 *
 * http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG14/www/docs/n2596.pdf 
 *
 * You can tell Clang to compile with C2x with the argument -std=c2x.  You'll need Clang 11 to do this.
 *
 * On the topic of arguments, I use the arguments -Wall -Wextra -pendantic -Werror for compiling this (in addition to -std=c2x).  Depending on who you ask, this may be considered overkill.  In any case, these only affect what messages the compiler gernerates, and theoretically shouldn't change the outputted ELF file.
 *
 * At certain points in the code, a `return` statement will be used to terminate the process with a specific code.  Information on these codescan be found in TROUBLESHOOTING.md.
 *
 * Licensing details on this code can be found in LICENSE.md.
 *
 * This game uses SDL and its libraries.  While I do my best to explain what these things does, it would still do you some good to look at the SDL wiki, available at https://wiki.libsdl.org.
 *
 * To link to SDL2, you need to append `sdl2-config --cflags --libs`, **with the graves**, to your compiling command. */

/* We begin with the setup. */

/* I need to add some of the C Standard Library for this to work.  The specific libraries I use from the CSL are used for the following purposes:
 *
 * - `<stdio.h>` is used for basic input-output systems, such as `printf`.
 * - `<stdlib.h>` is mostly used for the `atexit` function. 
 * - `<string.h>` is used to faff about with strings. */

It takes two points for the location of the top-left corner of the text, a string to use for the text, where to find the text images, and where to place the text.  To prevent overflow, the function will automatically newline at the boundary of the window. */
